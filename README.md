In folder `examples/MR`, the files are all ISMRMRD HDF5 files:
`grappa2_1rep.h5`  created by running the MATLAB function `gen_us_data.m` in `tools` repository. SNR intenionally low so that noise is visible.
`grappa2_6 rep.h5` as previous file but with 6 repetitions.

`simulated*` created from other code.
